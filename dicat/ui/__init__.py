"""
From https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html#packages documentation

The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat the directories as
containing packages; this is done to prevent directories with a common name,
such as string, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later on
the module search path. In the simplest case, __init__.py can just be an empty
file, but it can also execute initialization code for the package or set the
__all__ variable, described later.
